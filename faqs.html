                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>If your dog's coat is severely matted, we may need to perform additional de-matting work or recommend a shorter clip for your dog's comfort and safety.</p>
                    <p>Heavy matting can cause:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Skin irritation and discomfort</li>
                        <li>Restricted movement</li>

                    <p>We'll always discuss options with you before proceeding, and additional charges may apply for extensive de-matting work. Regular grooming (every 6-8 weeks) helps prevent matting.</p>

                    <p>We welcome puppies from 12 weeks old (after they've had their vaccinations). The first groom is an important introduction to grooming and we keep it gentle and positive.</p>
                    <p>First puppy groom includes:</p>

For anxious dogs, we take extra time to make them comfortable, use calming techniques and positive reinforcement, and schedule appointments at quieter times if needed. If your dog shows aggressive behavior that could pose a safety risk, we may need to stop the grooming session. We'll always discuss the situation with you and explore alternative solutions."
